<h1>node-bindings</h1>
<h3>Helper module for loading your native module's <code>.node</code> file</h3>
<p>This is a helper module for authors of Node.js native addon modules.
It is basically the &quot;swiss army knife&quot; of <code>require()</code>ing your native module's
<code>.node</code> file.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of Node's native addon history, addons have ended up being
compiled in a variety of different places, depending on which build tool and which
version of node was used. To make matters worse, now the <code>gyp</code> build tool can
produce either a <strong>Release</strong> or <strong>Debug</strong> build, each being built into different
locations.</p>
<p>This module checks <em>all</em> the possible locations that a native addon would be built
at, and returns the first one that loads successfully.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Install with <code>npm</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm install --save bindings
</code></pre>
<p>Or add it to the <code>&quot;dependencies&quot;</code> section of your <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p><code>require()</code>ing the proper bindings file for the current node version, platform
and architecture is as simple as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var bindings = require('bindings')('binding.node')

// Use your bindings defined in your C files
bindings.your_c_function()
</code></pre>
<h2>Nice Error Output</h2>
<p>When the <code>.node</code> file could not be loaded, <code>node-bindings</code> throws an Error with
a nice error message telling you exactly what was tried. You can also check the
<code>err.tries</code> Array property.</p>
<pre><code>Error: Could not load the bindings file. Tried:
