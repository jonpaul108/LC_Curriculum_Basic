# Iterations
This is the most challenging and longest unit in the basic section. It is built upon the challenges presented in the previous three units. Your challenge is now to use all your knowledge of objects, arrays, and strings as well as iterations and data access to solve increasingly difficult prompts. 

### Objectives
By practicing these problems, you will review or gain the following:
- *Ability to use complex iterations (including iterating by various numbers and decrementing)*
- *Complete understand of loops as general purpose iterations*
- *Elevated problem solving and prompt comprehension skills*
- *Deeper understanding of data and data structures*
######
By the end of this unit, you will be solving prompts similar to beginning level of the intermediate section.
