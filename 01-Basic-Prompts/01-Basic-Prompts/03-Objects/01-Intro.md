# Objects

This set of prompts focuses on working with objects.

### Objectives
By practicing these problems, you will review or gain the following:
- *Greater comprehension of prompt directions using instructions and inputs/outputs*
- *Correct application of dot/bracket notation*
- *Increased confidence solving complex objects without the use of 'for...in' iterations or built in methods*
- *Accurate understanding of object and array differences*
- *Ease of traversing nested structures* 
  
### Before you get started
This unit builds directly from the last unit. If you would like to review dot/bracket notation through some simpler challenges, the previous unit provides some prompts serving as a review.

### Constraints

Finally, *you should not loop over objects to solve these prompts*.  
######
Some of these prompts may require looping over strings or arrays. *Looping over arrays and strings is often valid.* However, *looping over objects is seldom necessary and therefore amounts to an anti-pattern*.  
######
This means you should not loop over any objects to access properties within this practice curriculum, both in this unit and beyond. Furthermore, the use of methods that also loop over objects, including Object.keys and Object.values, should not be implemented.  
######
*It is not typical to loop over an object* in the real world. If you loop over an object you may still pass some of the prompts or some of the tests. However, it is important you rework solutions that loop over objects.
