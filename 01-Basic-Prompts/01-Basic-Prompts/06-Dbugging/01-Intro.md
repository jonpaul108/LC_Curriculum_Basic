# Debugging

The final unit of the basic section, `debugging`, introduces you to debugging. Here you will be confronted with written code containing one or more logical errors. 
######
*It is your goal to solve the prompts based on the intention of the original coder, not to resolve these prompts from scratch*.  
 
Most of the necessary changes are very small. By working to understand how the code works and why the code is incorrect you should come to an understanding of these small but significant errors.
######
This platform is limited in the ability to debug. It is advisable to use a repl or IDE (such as VS code) in your efforts to debug. 
######
When debugging, if the error is not obvious, you should:
- log
- read code using example data
- run test data
- understand the bug before making changes (i.e. not engaging in "try and see" style of debugging)
######
By implementing the above strategies, you should be able to solve the prompt by:
- finding and understanding the bug
- making small changes to fix the issues
- not deleting and starting over

##

### Objectives
By the end of this unit, you should have:
- Better understanding of common errors
- Further understanding of your debugging process
- Stronger ability to read code written by others
- Deeper understanding of some common methods
- Deeper understanding of basic Javascript syntax
