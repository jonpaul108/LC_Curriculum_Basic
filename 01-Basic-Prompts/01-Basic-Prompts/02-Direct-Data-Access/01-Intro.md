# Direct Data Access

This unit challenges understanding of data access using dot and bracket notation, indexes, and keys.

### Objectives
The goal is for you to review or gain the following:
- *Strong skills working with string and array indexes*
- *Accurate implementation of dot vs bracket* 
- *Understand chaining dot and bracket* 
- *Decreased reliance on unnecessary loops*
  
### Constraints
All prompts are solvable without iterations of any kind. In other words, *loops/iterations should not be used to solve these problems.*  

######
Together, the instructions and the inputs/outputs should present a clear picture as to the expected structure of data, providing enough information to clarify why a loop is unnecessary in each situation.  

If you believe a loop is needed, reread the prompt directions or check the example input/outputs for clarification.
